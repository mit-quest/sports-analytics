###Try it yourself:

#### **1. Prepare data**

For player identification,  data should consist of a directory for each player in the videos.*

**If you'd like to adapt this code for other purposes, please structure your data accordingly; for instance, to identify actions from pose, each directory should contain clips of that action being performed.*

#### **2. Run pose estimation**

#### **3. ConvLSTM for player ID**
